## OVERVIEW

This project explores the relationship between mobile money usage(such as Mpesa adoption) and Kenya's GDP growth using data sourced from World Bank and other datasets.

It demonstrates how to perform data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis(EDA), and visualization using Python libarries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## OBJECTIVES

Analyze the trends in mobile money transactions and GDP growth over time

Explore whether the rise of mobile money correlates with economic growth in Kenya.

Use data visualization and correlation analysis to uncover meaningful insights.

Demonstrates how open data can be used for real-world economic analysis.
